# Git - Version Control System

**Git** is the most popular **Version Control System (VCS)** in the world.

Git is a *free and open source* distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git records the changed made to our code in a special database called repository. It enable us to look into our project history, and see what changes where made, by whom, when and why. And if we mess something it we can easily revert our project back to an earlier state.
